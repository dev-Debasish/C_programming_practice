/*
The statement is false.

Here's why:

If s is a 1-dimensional array of integers, say int s[3];, then s is a pointer to the first element of the array (s is equivalent to &s[0]).

The expression *(s + 3) actually refers to the fourth element of the array, not the third.

Explanation:
In pointer arithmetic, when you write s + 3, you are moving the pointer s three elements forward. Since arrays in C are zero-indexed:

s or s + 0 points to s[0] (the first element).
s + 1 points to s[1] (the second element).
s + 2 points to s[2] (the third element).
s + 3 points to s[3] (the fourth element).
Therefore, *(s + 3) dereferences the pointer at s + 3, which gives you the value of s[3], the fourth element in the array.

Summary:
*(s + 3) refers to the fourth element in the array, not the third.
