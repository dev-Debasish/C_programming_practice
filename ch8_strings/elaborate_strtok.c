Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Initial Tokenization:

token = strtok(str, " ,");

Purpose: 
    The strtok function is called for the first time with two arguments: the string str and a string containing delimiter characters (" ," in this case).

Functionality:
    strtok(str, " ,"): strtok scans the string str from the beginning, searching for the first occurrence of any of the delimiter characters (space ' ' or comma ',').
Token Extraction:
     When it finds a delimiter, strtok replaces that delimiter in the original string with a null character \0, effectively splitting the string at that point. It then returns a pointer to the first token (the substring before the delimiter).

Example:

If str = "Hello, World! This is a test.", after this call, strtok will return a pointer to "Hello", and the string str will now look like this: "Hello\0 World! This is a test.".
The token pointer now points to "Hello".


2. Looping Through the Tokens:

while (token != NULL) {

Purpose: 
    The while loop continues to run as long as token is not NULL.
First Iteration:
     On the first iteration, token points to the first token ("Hello" in the example), so the loop body executes.



3. Printing the Token:

printf("Token: %s\n", token);

Purpose: 
    This line prints the current token that token points to.
Example Output: 
    In the first iteration, this would print:

Token: Hello


4. Getting the Next Token:

token = strtok(NULL, " ,");

Purpose: 
    After processing the current token, strtok is called again to get the next token.
Functionality:
1)   strtok(NULL, " ,"): Passing NULL as the first argument tells strtok to continue tokenizing the same string from where it left off in the previous call.
2)    strtok continues scanning the string from the character right after the last delimiter it found and replaced.
3)    It finds the next delimiter, replaces it with \0, and returns a pointer to the next token.

Example:

1)    After processing "Hello", strtok(NULL, " ,") will return "World!", and str will now look like "Hello\0 World!\0This is a test.".
2)    The token pointer now points to "World!".


5. Loop Continuation:
1)    The loop continues, processing each subsequent token ("World!", "This", "is", "a", "test.") until strtok can no longer find any tokens, at which point it returns NULL.
2)    Once token becomes NULL, the loop exits.

Example of Full Output:

Given the string "Hello, World! This is a test." and the delimiters " ,", the output would be:

Token: Hello
Token: World!
Token: This
Token: is
Token: a
Token: test.

Summary:
First Call: 
    strtok(str, " ,") initializes the tokenization and returns the first token.
Subsequent Calls: 
    strtok(NULL, " ,") is called inside the loop to continue extracting tokens until no more tokens are found.
Loop:
     The while loop prints each token until strtok returns NULL, indicating no more tokens are left in the string.
